Regular Expression Matching

##Instructions:

1. Run main.py as:
	`python main.py`

2. Accepts input as:
	`<regular expression>`
	`<no of test cases>`
	`<list of test cases>`

3. You can also pipe in the input. A few sample input files have been attached: inp, inp2, inp3, inp4.

4. Note I have assumed that the alphabet consists of only small case letters. Capital letters are not handled by my program.
